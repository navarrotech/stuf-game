- If a user creates a new game while hosting or being a part of another one, have them leave the old one first.
    - Socket disconects might handle this?
- On game ended, go to a "thanks for playing" screen
- What if the current player leaves?
- What if a player leaves in the middle of submissions? Need to recalc if submissions are done or not.
- What if host leaves the game?
- Session id needs to be saved as a value, as the req.session.id value can rotate?
- Have some fun app responses like "y'all are nasty" when there's a lot of NSFW or "player 1 must be really horny?"
- Must have at least 3 players to play
