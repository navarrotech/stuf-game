Fun ideas:
- Have some fun app responses like "y'all are nasty" when there's a lot of NSFW or "player 1 must be really horny?"
- Vote kick or kick/ban ability
- Show game id in top right corner 24/7, clickable to copy link.

MVP:
- Sound effects
- Mobile
- If a user creates a new game while hosting or being a part of another one, have them leave the old one first.
    - Socket disconects might handle this?
- What if the current player leaves?
- What if a player leaves in the middle of submissions? Need to recalc if submissions are done or not.
- What if host leaves the game?
- Implement settings
- Implement endscreen
- How to play screen
- On game ended, go to a "thanks for playing" screen
